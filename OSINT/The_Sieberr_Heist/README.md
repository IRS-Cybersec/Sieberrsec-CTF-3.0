# "The Sieberr" Heist
_Author: hongxun_

## Part 1 [100|60]
Well, boss instructed me not to reveal much, but we're planning some heist and I need your help.

One of our men tailed someone to their home quite a while back.

He discreetly took a quick picture to mark the location of the person's house.

Please help me determine the location.

*(Actually, the heist was planned to be carried out sometime then, but due to unforeseen circumstances it was delayed and we are now revisiting the resources we had obtained back then).*

## Part 2 [400|333]
We retrieved this photo from the person's phone. 

How did we get it? You don't need to know, don't be silly and ask too many questions.

Anyway, the IT team commented that the guy seemed particularly interested in this photo. Unfortunately though, they were not able to find more info.

Tell me as much information as you can deduce from this photo.

## Part 3 [300|286]
Alright, there are some new developments and I need your help again.

The guy's name is Casrihms Myrert, you can find him on social media.

He's going to a hospital to visit someone's kid, but we hear that there is another person that he will be visiting in the same hospital. This other person is of interest to us.

Let me know what hospital he is going to, as well as what bus he is taking.
