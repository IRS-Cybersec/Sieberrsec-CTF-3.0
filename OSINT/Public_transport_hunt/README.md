# Public Transport Hunt [450|380]
My friend stole my $10 book voucher and camera away and took these [pictures](youcantfindme.zip) of bus stops and train stations...

I have absolutely no idea where he is now.

Help me trace the sly path of his scheming thievery and get my voucher back!

You might even get the voucher if you are fast enough...
