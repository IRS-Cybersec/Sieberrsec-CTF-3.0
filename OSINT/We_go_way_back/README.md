# We go way back [100|85]
My old friends created an app and made a public presentation about it, but they changed the name to something stupid and wont tell me the old one. Could you help me find the old name?

I managed to get the [google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gXGdoVw9X2YxEdyfTn6Lz0sbmuzCYs8H9zd1EOlJHL4/edit#slide=id.p) they used when creating the slides

Flag format: IRS{*APPNAME*}

**A first blood prize of one (1) 500Â¥ coin is available for this challenge.** (note: delivery time may be significant)

# Notes
The flag is `IRS{IHungry}`. The expected solution was for participants to find the original copy of the slides on web.archive.org. To the consternation of the author, many participants downloaded the presentation and were able to obtain the app name via a cropped image retaining its original copy.
