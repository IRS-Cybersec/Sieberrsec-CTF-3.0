# I can't open this file? Part 1 [300|210]
Oh no, I've encrypted a file and deleted the original! Now I have a [file](flag.txt.encrypted) that is filled with rubbish. Thankfully I still have the encryption [script](encrypt.py), help me recover the original file! I'll even give you a flag if you do.
