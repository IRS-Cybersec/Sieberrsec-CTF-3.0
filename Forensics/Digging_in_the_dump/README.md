# Digging in the Dump
_Author: taiz2000_

## Part 1 [400|266]
Our friend, Alex, used to visit a website, but ever since his computer died the url to the website was lost!

The only hope now lies in his old hard drive, which was salvaged from his pc 

Hopefully something useful can be found <br>

Here is a dump of his %APPDATA% folder 

Can you help him find the website?

### Hints
 * You might want to use a SQLite Browser

### Note
Download link is a deadlink; the zip is too large to reproduce on this repo.

## Part 2 [300|292]
After finding that website, perhaps you can find the saved credentials to login to his account?<br>
(Using the same file in Pt. I)

Computer username: `Alex` <br>
Computer password: `Password1` <br>
(These are NOT the login credentials for the website)
