<h1>Press Release on Cybersecurity Incident</h1>
<p>
  Our preliminary investigations revealed that our systems did not perform adequate checks for <b>JSON WEB tokens</b> issued from SSO providers like Google.
  <br><br>This allowed attackers to login as TaiYang IT Solution users accounts such as taiyang.it.solution [ at ] gmail.com.
  <br><br>However, due to adequate IP address protection on our end, no user data was disclosed.
  <br><br>TaiYang IT Solution is rolling out a v2 portal which addresses the original security vulnerability.
